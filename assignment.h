// Assignment 3. Implement the functions declared below in assignment.cc. The
// goal of the assignment is to test the topics we covered as part of the
// model view projection and camera projection projection matrices.
//
// Send your solution as a single file and with the following format:
//
// assignment3_<firstname>_<lastname>.zip,
//
// where <first> is replaced with your firstname and <lastname> with your
// lastname. For example, in my case it would be:
//
// assignment3_victor_fragoso.zip.
//
// The zip file should include *only* source code of the project. Specifically,
// your and .cc files.
//
// Compilation. Use the instructions we saw in class to compile this project.
//
// Verification of solution. To verify your implementations, the project
// generates a binary called assignment under the created bin directory. When
// the implementations are likely to be correct all the tests run by the binary
// will be marked as OK.
